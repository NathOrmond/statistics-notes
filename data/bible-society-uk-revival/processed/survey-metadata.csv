# CRITICAL METHODOLOGICAL NOTES:
# 1. Sample sizes differ substantially (19,875 vs 12,455 weighted)
# 2. Question order differs: 2024 has binary question BEFORE frequency question  
# 3. Binary question in 2024 may prime respondents differently
# 4. The binary "Yes - in the past year" (24%) should theoretically equal the sum of 
#    frequency responses for past year attendance, but there are inconsistencies
# 5. Different weighted bases used for different questions within 2024 survey
# 6. No information provided about demographic weighting adjustments for immigration
# 7. YouGov panel methodology may have changed between 2018 and 2024
