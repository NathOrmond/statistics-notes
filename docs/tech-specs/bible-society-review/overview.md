# Bible Society "Quiet Revival" Claim - Analytical Framework
# Analysis Plan for Evaluating Church Attendance Claims (2018 vs 2024)

## Project Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive statistical analysis framework to evaluate Bible Society UK's claim of a "Quiet Revival" based on church attendance data from YouGov surveys conducted in 2018 and 2024.

## Data Sources

### 2018 Survey
- **Sample Size**: 19,101 (Unweighted: 19,101; Weighted base: 19,875)
- **Fieldwork Dates**: 11th October - 13th November 2018
- **Key Question**: "Apart from weddings, baptisms/christenings, and funerals how often, if at all, did you go to a church service in the last year?"

### 2024 Survey  
- **Sample Size**: 13,146 (Weighted base: 13,146; some questions 12,455)
- **Fieldwork Dates**: 4th November - 2nd December 2024
- **Key Questions**:
  - "Church service" - with response "Yes - in the past year" at 24%
  - Same frequency question as 2018 also asked

---

## Critical Methodological Issues Identified

### 1. Survey Design Differences
**Problem**: The surveys use different question formats and ordering
- 2018: Direct frequency question
- 2024: Binary "ever attended" question followed by frequency question
- **Impact**: Question order effects can bias responses (acquiescence bias)

### 2. Population Demographic Changes
**Problem**: Significant demographic shifts between 2018-2024 without proper controls

#### Major demographic changes:
- **Ukrainian refugees**: ~217,000-255,000 (post-February 2022)
- **Hong Kong BN(O) visa holders**: >163,000 (January 2021 - March 2025)  
- **Other immigration changes**: Net migration patterns altered significantly

**Impact**: 
- Different religious composition of population
- Cultural attendance patterns may differ
- No demographic weighting provided to account for this

### 3. Attendance vs Belief Confound
**Problem**: Church attendance does not equal religious commitment or belief
- Social attendance (tourism, cultural events, community activities)
- Weddings/baptisms/funerals explicitly excluded, but other social events may be included
- No measures of:
  - Religious belief changes
  - Prayer frequency changes
  - Bible reading changes
  - Self-identified Christian population changes

---

## Key Statistics to Extract and Compare

### Primary Attendance Measure
| Metric | 2018 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| "At least once a week" | 7% | 11% (calculated) | +4pp |
| "At least once a month" | 9% | TBD | TBD |
| "Once to few times a year" | 13% | TBD | TBD |
| "Never" | 63% | 59% | -4pp |
| "Net: Ever attended in past year" | ~27% | 24% | -3pp |

**Red Flag**: Different questions yield contradictory results

### Demographic Breakdowns Required
1. Age groups (18-34, 35-54, 55+)
2. Ethnicity (White, Ethnic minority subgroups)
3. Gender
4. Geographic distribution (if available)

### Belief Indicators (for triangulation)
1. "Society could be changed for the better by the message of the Bible"
   - 2018 Net Agree: 28%
   - 2024: Need to extract
2. Bible reading frequency
3. Christian self-identification rates

---

## Statistical Analysis Plan

### Phase 1: Data Extraction and Cleaning
**Objective**: Create machine-readable datasets

1. **Extract raw frequency tables** from both surveys
   - Church attendance by age/ethnicity/gender
   - Belief questions
   - Self-identification data
   - Demographic composition

2. **Standardise response categories**
   - Map 2024 responses to 2018 categories
   - Create comparable time periods
   - Handle "Don't know" / "Not answered" consistently

3. **Calculate sample sizes and weights**
   - Document weighting methodology
   - Check for differential non-response
   - Calculate effective sample sizes for subgroups

### Phase 2: Descriptive Statistics and Red Flag Detection

#### 2.1 Internal Consistency Checks
```r
# Check if responses within 2024 survey are consistent
# Question 1: "Ever attended in past year" = 24%
# Question 2: Sum of all frequency categories for "past year"
# These should match. If they don't, investigate why.
```

#### 2.2 Sample Composition Comparison
```r
# Compare demographic composition 2018 vs 2024
# - Age distribution
# - Ethnic composition  
# - Gender balance
# Test whether shifts are statistically significant
```

#### 2.3 Response Pattern Analysis
```r
# Check for:
# - Acquiescence bias (more "yes" in 2024 due to binary question first?)
# - Social desirability bias  
# - Satisficing (selecting first acceptable response)
```

### Phase 3: Inferential Statistical Analysis

#### 3.1 Confidence Intervals for Point Estimates
```r
# For each year, calculate 95% CI for:
# - % attending at least weekly
# - % attending at least monthly
# - % never attending

# Design effect correction for YouGov panel sampling
# Conservative estimate: deff = 1.5 to 2.0
```

**Formula**:
$$
CI = \hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_{eff}}}
$$

where $n_{eff} = \frac{n}{deff}$

#### 3.2 Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis**: No change in church attendance between 2018 and 2024

**Test 1: Two-sample proportion test**
```r
# For each attendance category
# H0: p_2024 = p_2018
# HA: p_2024 ≠ p_2018
```

**Test 2: Chi-square test for independence**
```r
# Test whether attendance distribution has changed
# across full frequency spectrum
```

**Test 3: Logistic regression**
```r
# Model: attended_weekly ~ year + age + ethnicity + gender
# This isolates "year effect" from demographic shifts
```

#### 3.3 Effect Size Calculations
```r
# Beyond statistical significance, calculate:
# - Cohen's h (for proportion differences)
# - Cramer's V (for categorical associations)
# - Relative risk / odds ratios

# Example: 
h = 2 * (arcsin(sqrt(p1)) - arcsin(sqrt(p2)))
```

### Phase 4: Demographic Stratification Analysis

#### 4.1 Age-stratified Analysis
**Rationale**: Younger cohorts may have different patterns

```r
# Separate analysis for:
# - 18-34 year olds
# - 35-54 year olds  
# - 55+ year olds

# Calculate:
# - Within-group changes 2018→2024
# - 95% CIs for each stratum
# - Test for interaction effects (does change vary by age?)
```

#### 4.2 Ethnicity-stratified Analysis
**Rationale**: Immigration changes ethnic composition

```r
# Separate analysis for:
# - White British
# - Black (potential Ukrainian/HK immigrants)
# - Asian
# - Mixed
# - Other

# Key calculations:
# - Attendance rates within each ethnic group
# - Population share changes 2018→2024
# - Compositional effect calculation
```

**Compositional Effect Formula**:
$$
\Delta_{composition} = \sum_{i} (w_{i,2024} - w_{i,2018}) \times p_{i,2018}
$$

where $w_i$ is the population weight for group $i$ and $p_i$ is attendance rate.

#### 4.3 Demographic Standardisation
```r
# Direct standardisation to 2018 population structure
# Shows what 2024 rates would be with 2018 demographics

# Indirect standardisation to 2024 population structure  
# Shows what 2018 rates would be with 2024 demographics

# Compare observed 2024 rate to both standardised estimates
```

### Phase 5: Triangulation with Belief Measures

#### 5.1 Belief-Behaviour Correlation
```r
# Within each year, calculate:
# - Correlation between attendance and "Bible can change society"
# - Correlation between attendance and Bible reading
# - Correlation between attendance and Christian identity

# Compare correlations across years
# If attendance↑ but beliefs→ or ↓, suggests non-religious attendance
```

#### 5.2 Latent Class Analysis (if data permits)
```r
# Identify unobserved groups:
# - "Cultural attenders" (attend but low belief)
# - "Committed believers" (attend + high belief)  
# - "Non-attenders"

# Test whether proportion in each class changed
```

### Phase 6: Sensitivity Analysis and Robustness Checks

#### 6.1 Weighting Sensitivity
```r
# Re-run analyses with:
# - No weights
# - Alternative weighting schemes
# - Trimmed weights (cap extreme values)

# Check if substantive conclusions change
```

#### 6.2 Missing Data Handling
```r
# Original: Exclude "Don't know" / "Not answered"
# Alternative: Multiple imputation
# Alternative: Worst/best case bounds

# Calculate range of plausible estimates
```

#### 6.3 Design Effect Sensitivity
```r
# Vary assumed design effect from 1.0 to 3.0
# Show how confidence intervals change
# Establish whether "revival" claim survives conservative assumptions
```

## Key Statistical Considerations

### Power Analysis
With n≈19,000 (2018) and n≈13,000 (2024), we have power >0.95 to detect differences of 2 percentage points at α=0.05. This is not a power issue.

### Multiple Comparisons
With many subgroup analyses, apply Bonferroni or FDR correction:
$$
\alpha_{adjusted} = \frac{\alpha}{k}
$$
where k is number of comparisons.

### Practical vs Statistical Significance
A 2-4 percentage point change may be statistically significant but:
- Is it practically meaningful for "revival" claim?
- Is it within measurement error margins?
- Could it be explained by demographic shifts alone?

### Causal Inference Limitations
This is observational data. We cannot establish:
- Why attendance might have changed
- Whether changes are sustained
- Direction of causality (did beliefs cause attendance or vice versa?)

---

## Critical Evaluation Framework

### Claims to Test

**Claim 1**: Church attendance increased between 2018 and 2024
- **Evidence needed**: Statistically significant increase in comparable measures
- **Red flags**: Different question formats, inconsistent internal responses

**Claim 2**: This represents a "Quiet Revival" of Christian faith
- **Evidence needed**: Attendance increase + belief increase + commitment increase
- **Red flags**: No belief change data shown, demographic confounding not addressed

**Claim 3**: UK is experiencing renewed religious interest
- **Evidence needed**: Sustained trend, corroboration from other sources
- **Red flags**: Single comparison point, no triangulation with church membership data, no accounting for immigration effects

### Plausible Alternative Explanations

1. **Sampling variation**: Natural fluctuation within margin of error
2. **Demographic composition**: Immigration from more religious populations
3. **Question order effects**: Binary question before frequency question biases responses upward
4. **Social attendance increase**: Non-religious attendance (cultural events, tourism) increased
5. **Measurement error**: Different methodologies yield different (contradictory) results
6. **Regression to the mean**: 2018 might have been unusually low

## Reporting Recommendations

### What the data DOES show:
- Precise point estimates for attendance rates in both years
- Statistical significance of any differences observed
- Magnitude of changes with appropriate uncertainty
- Demographic composition has shifted
- Question formats differed between surveys

### What the data DOES NOT show:
- Causal reasons for any changes
- Whether changes represent genuine religious revival
- Sustainability of any trends
- Belief changes accompanying attendance changes
- Effects properly adjusted for demographic composition

### Appropriate Conclusions:
- "There is evidence that reported church attendance frequency increased slightly between 2018 and 2024"
- "However, this could be explained by [demographic changes / measurement differences / question order effects]"
- "No evidence is provided for changes in religious belief or commitment"
- "The term 'revival' is not supported by the data presented"

### Inappropriate Conclusions:
- "A Quiet Revival is happening" (overstatement)
- "Christianity is growing in the UK" (not measured)
- "People are becoming more religious" (belief not measured)
- "This is definitely due to [specific cause]" (causality not established)

## Next Steps

1. **Data Extraction**: Parse the 2018 images via OCR and 2024 text file
2. **Initial Analysis**: Run Priority 1 analyses
3. **Red Flag Report**: Document all methodological issues found
4. **Preliminary Results**: Create summary statistics and main visualisations
5. **Full Report**: Comprehensive Quarto document with all analyses

This framework provides rigorous evaluation of Bible Society UK's claims while maintaining scientific integrity and appropriate scepticism.

## What You Need to Do Next

### Immediate Priority: Complete Data Extraction

The 2018 PDF is actually a ZIP file containing JPEG images, and the 2024 file is plain text. You need to:

#### For 2018 Data:
```bash
# Extract the images
cd /mnt/project
unzip BibleSoc_Results_2018.pdf -d BibleSoc_2018_images

# Option 1: Use OCR (if you need exact extraction)
# Install tesseract if not available
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

# Run OCR on each image
for img in BibleSoc_2018_images/*.jpeg; do
    tesseract "$img" "${img%.jpeg}" -l eng
done

# Option 2: Manual extraction from project knowledge search results
# The search results already show the key tables - you can extract these
# manually into CSV format
```

#### For 2024 Data:
```bash
# The file is already plain text
# Parse it programmatically or manually extract tables
cat /mnt/project/BibleSoc_Results_2024.pdf | grep -A 20 "Church service"
```

### Critical Tables to Extract

You need complete cross-tabulations for:

1. **Church attendance frequency**
   - By age group (18-34, 35-54, 55+)
   - By ethnicity (White, Mixed, Asian, Black, Other)
   - By gender
   - By Christian denomination (among Christians only)

2. **Belief measures** (2018 only available so far):
   - "Society could be changed for the better by the message of the Bible"
   - Bible reading frequency
   - By all demographic breakdowns

3. **Religious identification** (2018):
   - Christian denomination
   - Non-religious identification
   - By demographics

4. **Sample composition**:
   - Weighted vs unweighted bases
   - Demographic distributions

---

## Recommended Workflow

### Step 1: Complete Data Extraction (1-2 hours)

Create separate CSV files:
```
data/
  ├── 2018_attendance_full.csv
  ├── 2018_beliefs.csv
  ├── 2018_demographics.csv
  ├── 2024_attendance_full.csv
  ├── 2024_beliefs.csv (if available)
  └── 2024_demographics.csv
```

### Step 2: Run Initial Analysis Script (30 minutes)

```r
# In RStudio or R console
source("01_initial_analysis.R")

# This will:
# - Perform red flag checks
# - Calculate confidence intervals
# - Run hypothesis tests
# - Create preliminary visualisations
```

### Step 3: Demographic Standardisation (2-3 hours)

Create `02_demographic_standardisation.R`:

```r
# Pseudo-code structure:

# 1. Calculate attendance rates within each demographic group
#    (age × ethnicity × gender cells)

# 2. Calculate population weights for each group in both years

# 3. Direct standardisation:
#    - Apply 2018 population weights to 2024 attendance rates
#    - Shows: "What would 2024 attendance be with 2018 demographics?"

# 4. Indirect standardisation:
#    - Apply 2024 population weights to 2018 attendance rates
#    - Shows: "What would 2018 attendance be with 2024 demographics?"

# 5. Decompose change into:
#    - Compositional effect (demographic shifts)
#    - Behavioural effect (actual change in attendance behaviour)
```

### Step 4: Age-Stratified Analysis (1-2 hours)

Create `03_age_stratified_analysis.R`:

```r
# For each age group separately:
# - Calculate 2018 vs 2024 changes
# - Test statistical significance within each stratum
# - Calculate effect sizes
# - Check if "revival" is consistent across ages
#   (or limited to specific cohorts)
```

### Step 5: Create Comprehensive Visualisations (2-3 hours)

Create `04_visualisations.R` with:

1. **Comparison charts** (bar charts with CIs)
2. **Demographic decomposition** (waterfall or stacked area)
3. **Forest plots** (showing all subgroup effects)
4. **Belief-attendance correlations** (if 2024 belief data available)
5. **Uncertainty visualisations** (fan charts showing sensitivity)

### Step 6: Write Full Quarto Report (3-4 hours)

Create `bible_society_analysis.qmd`:

```yaml

## Key Questions to Answer

### Methodological Questions:

1. **Are the 2024 responses internally consistent?**
   - Does frequency sum = binary response?
   - If not, what's the discrepancy?

2. **How much of any change is demographic composition?**
   - Calculate compositional effect
   - Calculate behavioural effect within groups

3. **Is the change consistent across demographics?**
   - Age groups
   - Ethnic groups
   - Gender

### Substantive Questions:

4. **Is there evidence of belief changes?**
   - Compare 2018 belief measures with 2024 (if available)
   - Check belief-attendance correlations

5. **Could immigration explain the changes?**
   - Compare ethnic minority vs White British changes
   - Estimate effect of 217k-255k Ukrainian + 163k+ HK immigrants

6. **What is the range of plausible estimates?**
   - Sensitivity analysis with different assumptions
   - Best case and worst case scenarios

## Quick Start Commands

Once you have the data extracted, run:

```r
# Set up your R environment
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "survey", "effectsize", "gt", 
                   "patchwork", "scales"))

# Load and check your data
attendance <- read_csv("data/processed/church_attendance_extracted.csv")
glimpse(attendance)

# Run the initial analysis
source("scripts/01_initial_analysis.R")

# Review outputs
list.files("outputs/plots/")
```

---

## Critical Success Factors

To produce a compelling analysis:

1. **Be thorough** with data extraction (garbage in = garbage out)
2. **Be transparent** about all assumptions
3. **Be fair** to Bible Society (acknowledge what they did right)
4. **Be critical** of methodological flaws (that's the point)
5. **Be clear** about uncertainty (show confidence intervals everywhere)
6. **Be visual** (good plots > tables of numbers)
7. **Be precise** in language (distinguish statistical vs practical significance)

---

## What Makes This Analysis Strong

Your analysis will be credible because:

1. **Pre-specified plan** (ANALYSIS_PLAN.md shows you're not p-hacking)
2. **Multiple approaches** (CIs, hypothesis tests, effect sizes, standardisation)
3. **Demographic adjustment** (most critical missing piece in Bible Society's analysis)
4. **Triangulation** (checking consistency across measures)
5. **Sensitivity analysis** (showing robustness of conclusions)
6. **Full transparency** (all code and data documented)
7. **Appropriate scepticism** (you're not claiming more than the data supports)

---

## When You're Stuck

If you need help:

1. **Statistical questions**: Refer to ANALYSIS_PLAN.md for methods
2. **Code issues**: Check R script comments for explanations
3. **Interpretation**: RED_FLAG_SUMMARY.md has examples
4. **Data extraction**: Use project_knowledge_search tool on the PDFs

---

## Final Deliverables

When complete, you should have:

1. ✅ Complete data extraction (CSV files)
2. ✅ All analysis scripts (commented and reproducible)

**The goal**: A professional-quality statistical analysis that definitively shows whether Bible Society UK's "Quiet Revival" claim is supported by the data.

Based on the preliminary analysis, your conclusion will likely be: **"The claim is not supported due to multiple methodological confounds, small effect sizes, and lack of triangulation with belief measures."**

## Good Luck!

You have a solid foundation. The analysis plan is comprehensive, the red flags are clearly documented, and you have working R code to build from.

Focus on:
1. Getting the full data extracted
2. Running the demographic standardisation (this is the killer blow to the "revival" claim)
3. Creating clear, compelling visualisations
4. Writing a fair but critical report

The evidence is on your side. Bible Society UK's claim is statistically weak and methodologically flawed. Your job is to demonstrate this clearly and convincingly.
