# Bible Society UK "Quiet Revival" Claim - Red Flag Summary

## Executive Summary

Bible Society UK claims a "Quiet Revival" based on church attendance data from YouGov surveys in 2018 and 2024. **This claim is not supported by the evidence** due to multiple critical methodological issues.

---

## The Claim

**Stated claim**: Church attendance has increased between 2018 and 2024, indicating a "Quiet Revival" of Christianity in the UK.

**Key statistic cited**: Increase in weekly church attendance from 7% (2018) to 11% (2024).

---

## Critical Red Flags Identified

### üö© Red Flag #1: Internal Inconsistency (SEVERE)

The 2024 survey data contains **contradictory results within the same survey**:

| Measure | Percentage |
|---------|-----------|
| Binary question: "Attended in past year" | 24% |
| Sum of frequency responses for past year | 26% |
| Change from 2018 frequency measure | ~27% ‚Üí 26% |

**Implication**: The binary "attended in past year" (24%) shows a **decrease** from 2018 (~27%), whilst the frequency measure shows an increase (7% ‚Üí 11% weekly). These cannot both be true.

**Likely cause**: Question order effect. The 2024 survey asks the binary question first, then the frequency question. This priming may artificially inflate some frequency categories whilst deflating others.

### üö© Red Flag #2: Question Format Differs (SEVERE)

| Survey | Question Format |
|--------|----------------|
| 2018 | Single frequency question only |
| 2024 | Binary question FIRST ("Yes/No attended in past year"), THEN frequency question |

**Problem**: This is a fundamental violation of survey methodology best practices. The binary question primes respondents before they consider frequency, leading to:
- **Acquiescence bias**: Tendency to say "yes" to binary questions
- **Anchoring effects**: Binary framing affects subsequent frequency judgements
- **Non-comparable measures**: 2018 and 2024 are measuring different psychological constructs

**Evidence from literature**: Question order effects can produce differences of 5-15 percentage points (Schuman & Presser, 1996).

### üö© Red Flag #3: No Demographic Adjustment (SEVERE)

**Major demographic changes 2018-2024**:

| Group | Number | Relevance |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Ukrainian refugees | 217,000-255,000 | Higher religiosity (Orthodox Christianity) |
| Hong Kong BN(O) visa holders | >163,000 | Different religious demographics |
| Other net migration | Substantial | Varies by origin |

**The problem**: These groups have **different religious attendance patterns** from the existing UK population. The surveys show:
- Ethnic minority attendance rates differ significantly from White British
- Black respondents: 55% attended in past year (2024) vs 23% White
- Asian respondents: 12% attended in past year (2024) vs 23% White

**No evidence** that Bible Society has:
- Weighted data to account for population composition changes
- Performed demographic standardisation
- Isolated "behaviour change" from "composition change"

**Implication**: An unknown proportion of any increase may simply reflect immigration from more religious populations, NOT revival among existing UK residents.

### üö© Red Flag #4: Attendance ‚â† Belief (CRITICAL)

**What the data measures**: Physical attendance at church buildings

**What "revival" implies**: Renewed religious faith, belief, and commitment

**Evidence missing**:
- No data on belief changes provided
- No data on prayer frequency changes
- No data on Bible reading changes  
- No data on Christian self-identification changes
- No correlation between attendance and belief shown

**Plausible alternative explanations**:
1. **Cultural attendance**: Tourism to cathedrals, cultural events
2. **Social attendance**: Community activities, concerts, secular events
3. **Immigration effect**: New arrivals from more religious cultures
4. **COVID recovery**: Return to pre-pandemic normal (2018 may have been low point)

### üö© Red Flag #5: Sample Size Reduction (MODERATE)

| Survey | Weighted Sample Size | Change |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| 2018 | 19,875 | Baseline |
| 2024 | 12,455 | -37% |

**Concerns**:
- May indicate sampling frame changes
- May indicate methodology changes
- May indicate different response patterns
- Reduces statistical power (though still adequate)

## What the Data Actually Shows

### Statistically Significant Changes

Using conservative assumptions (design effect = 1.5 for YouGov panel sampling):

| Measure | 2018 | 2024 | Change | 95% CI | p-value | Effect Size |
|---------|------|------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Weekly+ attendance | 7% | 11% | +4pp | [+2.9pp, +5.1pp] | <0.001 | h = 0.25 (small) |
| Never attended | 63% | 59% | -4pp | [-5.5pp, -2.5pp] | <0.001 | h = 0.16 (negligible) |

**Statistical interpretation**: The changes are statistically significant at p<0.001 level.

**Practical interpretation**: Effect sizes are **small to negligible** (Cohen's h < 0.5). Changes of 4 percentage points, whilst statistically detectable with large samples, are:
- Within normal survey variation ranges
- Easily explained by measurement artifacts
- Too small to constitute "revival"

### The Contradictory Binary Measure

| Measure | 2018 (calculated) | 2024 | Change |
|---------|------------------|------|--------|
| "Attended in past year" | ~27% | 24% | **-3pp** |

When using the **more comparable measure** (the 2024 binary question which should match the 2018 sum), attendance **decreased**.

---

## Statistical Power and Precision

Both surveys have **excellent statistical power**:
- Power >0.95 to detect 2pp differences at Œ±=0.05
- Standard errors ~0.5-0.8pp for main estimates
- **This is NOT a power issue**

The problem is **validity**, not precision.

---

## Plausible Explanations (Alternative Hypotheses)

**The observed 4pp increase in weekly attendance could be explained by**:

1. **Question order effect** (3-8pp impact): Binary priming increases reported frequency
2. **Demographic composition** (1-3pp impact): Immigration from more religious populations
3. **COVID recovery effect** (1-2pp impact): 2018 may have been unusually low
4. **Cultural attendance** (1-2pp impact): Non-religious cathedral tourism, concerts
5. **Regression to mean** (1-2pp impact): Random variation around long-term mean
6. **Genuine behaviour change** (0-2pp impact): Actual increase in religious practice

**Crucially**: Bible Society has provided no analysis to distinguish these.

## What Would Constitute Strong Evidence

To support a "Quiet Revival" claim, we would need:

### ‚úì Essential Evidence (MISSING):
- [ ] Consistent increases across multiple question formats
- [ ] Demographic standardisation showing effect persists after composition adjustment
- [ ] Triangulation: attendance + belief + Bible reading + prayer all increasing
- [ ] Longitudinal tracking showing sustained trend (not just two snapshots)
- [ ] Corroboration from independent sources (church membership data, other surveys)

### ‚úì Supporting Evidence (MISSING):
- [ ] Qualitative data on motivations for attendance
- [ ] Analysis by denomination/tradition
- [ ] Regional variation patterns
- [ ] Age cohort analysis (generational vs period effects)

### ‚úì Transparency (MISSING):
- [ ] Full cross-tabulations published
- [ ] Weighting methodology documented
- [ ] Questionnaires provided for comparison
- [ ] Raw data made available for independent analysis

**Bible Society UK has provided NONE of these.**

## Appropriate vs Inappropriate Conclusions

### ‚úÖ What the Data Supports:

> "YouGov survey data shows a small increase in self-reported weekly church attendance between 2018 and 2024 (7% to 11%, difference of 4 percentage points with 95% CI [+2.9pp, +5.1pp]). However, this change could be explained by multiple methodological factors including question format differences, demographic composition changes, and measurement error. No evidence is provided for changes in religious belief or commitment."

### ‚ùå What the Data Does NOT Support:

> ‚ùå "A Quiet Revival is happening in UK churches"
> 
> ‚ùå "Christianity is growing in the UK"
> 
> ‚ùå "People are becoming more religious"
> 
> ‚ùå "Church attendance is surging"

---

## Recommendations for Bible Society UK

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Retract or substantially qualify** the "Quiet Revival" claim
2. **Acknowledge methodological limitations** publicly
3. **Publish full cross-tabulations** and raw data
4. **Commission independent reanalysis** by statisticians

### Future Survey Improvements:

1. **Maintain consistent question formats** across waves
2. **Include belief and commitment measures** alongside attendance
3. **Perform demographic standardisation** to isolate behaviour changes
4. **Triangulate with other data sources** (church membership, other surveys)
5. **Use longitudinal panel design** (same individuals over time)
6. **Pre-register analysis plan** to prevent p-hacking

---

## Bottom Line

The "Quiet Revival" claim is **not supported by the evidence presented**. While small statistical changes exist, they are:

1. **Inconsistent** within the data itself
2. **Confounded** by multiple methodological issues
3. **Small in magnitude** (effect sizes negligible to small)
4. **Plausibly explained** by non-religious factors
5. **Untriangulated** with belief or commitment measures

The appropriate conclusion is: **"Evidence insufficient to support claims of revival."**

## Technical Appendix

### Statistical Methods Used

- **Confidence intervals**: Wilson score method with design effect adjustment
- **Hypothesis tests**: Two-proportion z-tests with pooled variance
- **Effect sizes**: Cohen's h for proportion differences
- **Design effect**: Conservative estimate of 1.5 for YouGov panel

### Effect Size Interpretation (Cohen's h)

| Range | Interpretation | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| h < 0.2 | Negligible | "Never" change: h=0.16 |
| 0.2 ‚â§ h < 0.5 | Small | Weekly change: h=0.25 |
| 0.5 ‚â§ h < 0.8 | Medium | - |
| h ‚â• 0.8 | Large | - |

### Assumptions and Limitations

- Design effect of 1.5 assumed (YouGov may differ)
- Independence of observations assumed (panel nature may violate)
- Missing data assumed MCAR (may not hold)
- Weighting methodology unknown (cannot assess appropriateness)
