## Welcome to Statistics Concepts

This website provides interactive demonstrations and explanations of fundamental statistical concepts. Each page contains hands-on examples with R code that you can run and modify to deepen your understanding.

## Available Topics

### [Central Limit Theorem](concepts/central-limit-theorem.html)
Understanding how sampling distributions approach normality regardless of the original distribution's shape.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Visualize the transformation from skewed to normal distributions
- Explore the effect of sample size on sampling distributions
- Understand the mathematical foundation of the CLT

### Coming Soon...

- **Confidence Intervals**: Understanding uncertainty in parameter estimation
- **Hypothesis Testing**: The logic of statistical significance
- **Regression Analysis**: Modeling relationships between variables
- **Probability Distributions**: Common distributions and their properties

## How to Use This Site

1. **Read the Introduction**: Each concept page starts with an overview
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the R code blocks to see the demonstrations
3. **Experiment**: Modify parameters to see how they affect the results
4. **Understand the Math**: Review the mathematical foundations provided

## Technical Requirements

- R (version 4.0 or higher)
