## Welcome

This website brings together my work exploring statistical concepts through **interactive demonstrations** and **data analysis**. Whether you're learning statistics or interested in critical analysis of research papers, you'll find hands-on examples with R code that you can run, modify, and learn from.

## About This Project

This site is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and uses R for all statistical demonstrations. All code is reproducible and available for you to experiment with. The goal is to make statistical concepts more accessible through hands-on learning.

All of the source code for this project can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/NathOrmond/statistics-notes.git](https://github.com/NathOrmond/statistics-notes.git)

## Getting Started

1. Explore the [Teaching Statistics](src/teaching-stats/core-concepts/index.html) section to learn core concepts
2. Check out [Paper Reviews](src/blog/paper-reviews/index.html) for critical analysis
3. Run and modify the R code examples to experiment with the concepts

**Technical Requirements:** R (version 4.0+) and a modern web browser. Required R packages will be automatically installed when you run the code blocks.
