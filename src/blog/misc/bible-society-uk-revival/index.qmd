## Overview

This section contains a comprehensive analysis of Bible Society UK's claim of a "Quiet Revival" based on YouGov survey data comparing church attendance patterns between 2018 and 2024.

The claim asserts that weekly church attendance increased from 7% (2018) to 11% (2024), representing a 4 percentage point increase. However, our analysis identifies multiple critical methodological issues that cast serious doubt on this claim.

## Key Findings

Our analysis reveals multiple red flags:

1. **Internal Inconsistencies**: The 2024 survey shows contradictory results
2. **Question Order Effects**: Different question formats make comparison invalid
3. **Demographic Confounds**: Population changes may explain apparent increases
4. **Small Effect Sizes**: Even if statistically significant, practical significance is limited
